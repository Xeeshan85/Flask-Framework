# Flask-Framework
Mini learning projects with flask web frame work and sqlite

In this project I have created two branches
- First brach is to user management system / You can say it as todo list just need to change some columns.
- Second branch is to read cricket match data from a csv file. Then convert that data into db file and created a dashboard to display that data also perform some basic filtering.
